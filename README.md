1. Overview

The provided code is a simple implementation of a library management system using Python classes. It consists of three main classes: "Book", "Patron", and "Library". These classes interact with each other to simulate various library operations such as adding books, registering patrons, and managing book borrowing.


2. Class Descriptions

1 = BOOK CLASS
The "Book" class represents a book in the library. It has the following attributes:

"title": The title of the book.
"author": The author of the book.
"publication_year": The year the book was published.
"availability": A boolean indicating whether the book is available for borrowing (default is True).
The "Book" class has one method:

"display_book_details()": Prints the details of the book.
        
        
2 = Patron Class
The "Patron" class represents a patron of the library. It has the following attributes:

"name": The name of the patron.
"patron_id": A unique ID for the patron.
"borrowed_books": A list of books borrowed by the patron.
The Patron class has one method:

"manage_borrowed_books": Adds a book to the patron's borrowed books list if the book is available. If the book is not available, it prints a message indicating that the book is not available.


3 = Library Class
The "Library" class represents the library itself. It has the following attributes:

"books": A list of books in the library.
"patrons": A list of registered patrons.

The "Library" class has three methods:
 add_book(book): Adds a book to the library's book list.
 "register_patron": Registers a new patron and adds them to the library's patron list.
 "manage_patron_interactions": Manages interactions between a patron and a book. If the patron is registered, it calls the "manage_borrowed_books" method of the patron class. If the patron is not registered, it prints a message indicating that the patron is not registered.


3. Code Walkthrough

The code defines the "Book", "Patron", and "Library" classes with their respective attributes and methods.
It creates instances of the "Book" and "Patron" classes: "book1", "book2", "patron1", and "patron2".
It creates an instance of the "Library" class: "library".
It adds "book1" and "book2" to the library using the "add_book" method.
It registers "patron1" and "patron2" with the library using the "register_patron" method.
It simulates various library operations:
  "patron1" borrows "book1" using the "manage_patron_interactions method".
  "patron2" borrows "book2" using the" manage_patron_interactions method".
  "patron1" attempts to borrow "book2", which is already borrowed by "patron2".


## sample output
To Kill a Mockingbird has been added to the library.
1984 has been added to the library.
John Doe has been registered.
Jane Doe has been registered.
John Doe has borrowed To Kill a Mockingbird.
Jane Doe has borrowed 1984.
1984 is not available.
